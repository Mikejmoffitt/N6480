Phase 1.1  Initial Placement Analysis (Checksum:866) REAL time: 3 secs 

Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
ERROR:Place:1136 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <clock_BUFGP/BUFG>, driving the net, <clock_BUFGP>, that is driving the
   following (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: XLXI_74.A6; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
   < PIN "clock_BUFGP/BUFG.O" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >
